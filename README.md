# adventCode
The Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge where participants solve a series of increasingly complex problems using programming languages of their choice. This GitHub repository contains solutions to these problems from me using different programming language for each year of the challenge. The challenge provides a great opportunity to learn a new programming language each year by attempting to solve the problems with it. By doing so, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge in the syntax and capabilities of various programming languages, and improved my problem-solving skills. Please check out my repository and let me know your thoughts on how my solutions compare to yours!
